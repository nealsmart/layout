<p>Ideal map layout depends greatly on the gameplay logic of each game, meaning that each game requires a unique approach to development of levels. Creation of these levels is a time consuming process, one which isn't guaranteed to end with an ideal map. The purpose of this project is to initially aid in the development of levels by providing a good flow map to base the map on, then eventually be able to generate entire levels from scratch.</p>

<a id="solving-the-problem" class="anchor" href="#solving-the-problem" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Solving the problem</h3>

<p>The system is, in essence, a combinatoric problem solver. By representing a level as a node graph, the system can generate and then analyze the performance of the map according to the many aspects of level design theory for Counter-Strike.</p>

<p>Two teams, terrorists and counter-terrorists spawn in a map. The counter-terrorists move to secure two bombsites located within the map. The terrorists fight to gain control of one of these bombsites to plant a bomb. When the bomb is planted, remaining counter-terrorists move to take back the site and defuse the bomb.</p>

<p>The community of Counter-Strike is growing every day, peaking at over 600,000 concurrent players within the past week. The current map pool only consists of seven competitive maps and eight secondary maps. Twice a year, seven new maps by community members are temporarily added as a third pool of maps to choose from.</p>

<p>For frequent players, the map pool can get quite repetitive. By providing a solid framework to design a map around, and eventually a complete graybox map, players hungry for new gameplay experiences can play upon these, and designers can adopt these levels to fine-tune with playtesting and artpass them for release.</p>

<h3>
<a id="methods" class="anchor" href="#methods" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Methods</h3>

<p>To test the map, a basic simulator was constructed. Two teams of five units each are placed in at their appropriate spawn points. The Terrorists will target and move to a bombsite. The Counter Terrorists will secure the holding routes, then once contact is made, move to the bombsite that is being targeted. A unit that is stationed at a point will have a defensive bonus, and will win 60% of the encounters. Two units that are moving and encounter each other will both have a 50% chance of eliminating the enemy.</p>
