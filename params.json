{"name":"Flow Map Generation for Counter-Strike","tagline":"","body":"![Cache](https://i.imgur.com/u1BYlbZ.jpg)\r\n\r\n### What is the purpose of this project?\r\nIdeal map layout depends greatly on the gameplay logic of each game, meaning that each game requires a unique approach to development of levels. Creation of these levels is a time consuming process, one which isn't guaranteed to end with an ideal map. The purpose of this project is to initially aid in the development of levels by providing a good flow map to base the map on, then eventually be able to generate entire levels from scratch.\r\n\r\n### Solving the problem\r\nThe system is, in essence, a combinatoric problem solver. By representing a level as a node graph, the system can generate and then analyze the performance of the map according to the many aspects of level design theory for Counter-Strike.\r\n\r\nTwo teams, terrorists and counter-terrorists spawn in a map. The counter-terrorists move to secure two bombsites located within the map. The terrorists fight to gain control of one of these bombsites to plant a bomb. When the bomb is planted, remaining counter-terrorists move to take back the site and defuse the bomb.\r\n\r\n![Flow Map](http://i.imgur.com/0PtkiXj.png)\r\n\r\n### What significance does this have to the Counter-Strike community?\r\nThe community of Counter-Strike is growing every day, peaking at over 600,000 concurrent players within the past week. The current map pool only consists of seven competitive maps and eight secondary maps. Twice a year, seven new maps by community members are temporarily added as a third pool of maps to choose from.\r\n\r\nFor frequent players, the map pool can get quite repetitive. By providing a solid framework to design a map around, and eventually a complete graybox map, players hungry for new gameplay experiences can play upon these, and designers can adopt these levels to fine-tune with playtesting and artpass them for release.\r\n\r\n### Methods\r\nTo test the map, a basic simulator was constructed. Two teams of five units each are placed in at their appropriate spawn points. The Terrorists will target and move to a bombsite. The Counter Terrorists will secure the holding routes, then once contact is made, move to the bombsite that is being targeted. A unit that is stationed at a point will have a defensive bonus, and will win 60% of the encounters. Two units that are moving and encounter each other will both have a 50% chance of eliminating the enemy.\r\n\r\n### Results of 10,000 simulations each\r\n![CTvT 5v5](http://i.imgur.com/H9mt1KU.png)\r\n![CTvT 6v5](http://i.imgur.com/lmrBxmA.png)\r\n![CTvT 5v6](http://i.imgur.com/lchvqgc.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Using the System\r\nProcess of generating a graph:\r\n[FlowMapLayout Example](https://github.com/nealsmart/layout/blob/gh-pages/flowMapLayout.ipynb)\r\nRunning the simulator:\r\n[Simulator Example](https://github.com/nealsmart/layout/blob/gh-pages/simulator%20example.ipynb)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
