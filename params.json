These maps will adhere to the layout theory of Counter-Strike to ensure ideal and unique gameplay. By representing the a as a node graph, aspects related to the flow can be determined as a combinatoric problem. From there, random graphs can be generated and scored based on established criteria.\r\n\r\n### Why\r\nCreation of Counter-Strike maps is a time consuming process, where designers must first create plans for a layout, build this layout in the game, and run exhaustive human testing to determine if the layout is ideal. This generator aims to generate a flow map for the layout that will greatly improve the chances that the map will be ideal, eliminating wasted time on failed plans.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
